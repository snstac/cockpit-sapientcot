# cockpit-sapientcot — AIS vessel tracking for TAK, in your browser

A [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) web console plugin for
[SAPIENTCOT](https://github.com/snstac/sapientcot), the **SAPIENT to TAK gateway**. Track
**ships and vessels via AIS** (RTL-SDR + AIS-catcher, 161.975/162.025 MHz) and display
them in **ATAK, WinTAK, iTAK, and TAK Server** as Cursor on Target — maritime domain
awareness for ports, waterways, search & rescue, and coastal operations. Service
control, `/etc/default/sapientcot` configuration, TAK TLS certificates, and live status —
no SSH required.

# Installing

Install the `.deb` from the GitHub Releases page, or `make install` compiles and installs the package in `/usr/local/share/cockpit/`.

## The snstac TAK sensor ecosystem

Different sensor, same workflow — pick the gateway for your application; most have a
